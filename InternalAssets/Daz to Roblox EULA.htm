    <p>
        By using Daz to Roblox, you agree to these Daz to Roblox Terms (“Supplemental Terms”) which you agree supplement your obligations under the Daz End User License Agreement (“EULA”). 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">A. Restrictions:</span> Importing Daz Characters into Roblox Studio requires this supplement to the standard EULA, because the assets are uploaded to the Roblox servers. As a limited exception to the EULA, these Supplemental Terms grant you the right to upload assets that you have purchased from the Daz store using your own account into a single Roblox account which is also your personal account. You hereby agree that: (1) these Supplemental Terms are specific to Roblox and do not permit you to upload Daz Studio Assets to any other third-party platform; (2) you are only permitted to upload the Daz Studio assets to a single Roblox account for your own personal use or for sale within the Roblox platform for in-game currency; (3) you still must purchase all applicable assets from Daz before uploading them to Roblox in accordance with these Supplemental Terms.; and (4) these Supplemental Terms do not give you the right to transfer any assets that were not purchased from the Daz store.

                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">B. Monitoring of Content; Liability and Disclaimers:</span> You understand and agree that Roblox uses both automated and human moderation to review assets uploaded to its servers. Uploaded assets which are rejected by Roblox moderation may result in actions by the Roblox moderation team including removal of assets from the Roblox servers and/or banning of the user's Roblox account. It is your responsibility to ensure that assets uploaded to the Roblox servers comply with Roblox Community Standards, especially regarding Sexual Content and Age Appropriate Avatar bodies (“Roblox Policies”). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the EULA, Daz will not be liable for any damages arising from your use of Roblox, breach of the Roblox Policies, or any dispute between you and any other user on Roblox. In addition to your indemnification obligations in the EULA, you will indemnify, defend and hold Daz harmless from and against any third-party claim, including, without limitation, claims brought by Roblox or users of Roblox, relating to your breach of the Roblox Policies or otherwise arising from any dispute between you and another Roblox user.

                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">C. Daz Originals:</span> Daz Original assets may be identified in the Daz3d.com store by containing the words “Daz Originals” in the “Artist” field on the product page.  These Supplemental Rights apply to all Daz Originals that are transferred through Daz to Roblox while you have in place an active Daz Originals to Roblox Reseller subscription.

            <p>
                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">D. Other Assets:</span> Other Assets can be identified as any product in the Daz3d.com store which does not list “Daz Originals” in the Artist field of the product page, and which also offers the sale of a “Roblox Reseller License” on the product page.  By purchasing the Roblox Reseller License to any Other Asset, you gain these Supplemental Rights to that specific product.  These “Other Assets” do not require a Daz Originals to Roblox Reseller subscription.

            <p>
                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">E. Rights Upon Transfer to Roblox:</span> With respect to any Assets (whether Roblox Originals or Other Assets) which are purchased and transferred to Roblox in compliance with these terms, the rights granted under these Supplemental Terms are perpetual and you are free to resell and or use those Assets within Roblox in perpetuity in accordance with these Supplemental Terms (subject to any Roblox Policies).
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">F. General:</span> The EULA will remain in full force and effect and is modified by these Supplemental Terms solely with respect to your use of Daz to Roblox.  These Supplemental terms will remain in place in perpetuity for all assets you have transferred under these terms.
            </p>

        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">G. Reseller Size:</span> These Supplemental Terms are intended for any individuals or business entities with annual revenues less than $1,000,000 USD. Any individual or business entity with annual revenues in excess of $1,000,000 USD is allowed these rights ONLY with the express written consent of DAZ.

                <span class="bs5-fw-bold">H. Beta Period for Daz Originals:</span> The period February 19th, 2025 – March 18th 2025 shall be classified as a “Beta Period”.  During this Beta Period, all users shall have the rights granted by these Supplemental Terms for all Daz Originals, without the need to have a Daz Originals to Roblox Reseller subscription.  For the avoidance of doubt, after the Beta Period you must purchase a Roblox Reseller Subscription to transfer Daz Originals in accordance with these Supplemental Terms.
